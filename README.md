A brand new robe for dropwizard.
-------------------------------
Motivation
-------------------------------

Robe is a perspective which eliminates the complications and problems occurred in a software development chain by following the approach of Dropwizard.
Robe solves these complication by including various production ready libraries along with dropwizard.

**Robe.Auth :** This package includes user role and permission mechanisms. We tried to implement ESAPI interfaces to handle all difficult tasks at enterprise authentications. By getting inspired with Dropwizard we implemented a token based authentication system. 

**Robe.Quartz :** This package includes all the solutions of job related issues with the help of quartz library. We tried to make it easier with new annotations and a new management screen. You can manage all your quartz jobs with a management UI and persistent DB store.

**Robe.Common :** This package is the common library module for all the robe modules. It includes a problem specific exception handler, common data transfer objects and file operations.

**Robe.Convert :** This package is designed for mapping methodology. It manages file importing and exporting between formats(xls, xlsx, xml, csv, tsv, json) to POJOs with the help of annotations. Annotations prevents the developer to write extra code for validating the procedure.
